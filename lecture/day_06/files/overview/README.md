- minimize repetition
- minimize data queries

## Why ERD first?

- define relationships

>Learning the design of the database first will help us visualize what our relational databases look like, which makes it much easier to choose the actual SQL syntax.

## Why ERD?

- it's a process of designing tables and establishing relationships between them
- non-relational databases where everything is stored in a single table
