# API (Application Programming Interface)
--
>APIs define a set of rules in which you can interact with a particular application. For web developers, all of those Useful URL's we covered are specifically designed to be used by other developers or web pages. With a set of governing principles on how an API should be designed, developers can access information in very logical steps.
